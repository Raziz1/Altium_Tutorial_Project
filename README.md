## Functional Requirements
The primary goal of this project was to design a power regulator shield board for the Arduino Uno that powers a bank of LEDs as well as the Arduino Uno. The design of the board had to meet the following set of requirements:
1. Receive power from a 12 V DC input
2. Regulate power down to 5 V DC
3. Deliver 12 V DC power to a bank of 2 LED lights in parallel
4. Provide 5 V DC power to the main Arduino Uno board
5. Provide enough current to power the Arduino and the LEDs
6. Regulate power with at least 90% efficiency
7. LEDs must be SMD parts with high power output (at least 10 W each)
8. Power input connection is provided by standard 16 AWG wire
9. Components must be placed only on the top layer
10. Total board thickness must be standard thickness (approximately 62 mils)
